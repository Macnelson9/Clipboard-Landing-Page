## Overview

I was able to get this done without facing any major challenges and I am super proud of myself for that. This challenge provides you with some pretty good tasks and I encourage everyone to attempt it.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started out by structuring out the HTML, then I moved further to build the layout using mobile-first CSS approach, and then the desktop layout afterwards.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS custom animations
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
